# LASD (Laboratorio di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati)

***I worked on this assignements with [@Akmadan23](https://github.com/Akmadan23)***

Collection of assignements for "Laboratorio di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati", a subject for the CS Bachelor Degree at UniPR (University of Parma).
Each file is divided according to the topic of the course, in particular:

## CONSEGNA N.1 - SORTING ALGORITHM
Customized sorting algorithm used to sort a predefined dataset (data.txt).

## CONSEGNA N.2 - BINARY TREE
Program that generates a binary tree, and tests on it the following functions:
  1) Tree-flip: for every node, the right subtree becomes the ledft subtree and viceversa
  2) Calculate the depth of every node of the tree
  3) isBalanced: return a flag that indicates if the tree is balanced or not
  4) isComplete: return a flag that indicates if the tree is complete or not, following the classic definition
  5) Lowest Common Ancestor: given two different values of the tree, return the value of the lowest node that contains both in his subtree

## CONSEGNA N.3 - CYCLIC GRAPH
Program that creates a random cyclic graph, with the following instruction:
  1) Visit the whole graph, even disconnected oarts
  2) Calculate the lenght of the longest cycle, and return its nodes

## CONSEGNA N.4 - SHORTEST PATH
Adaptation of the code to find the shortest path, modifying the extraction of the minimum node using the heap, 
guaranteeing the log(n) complexity and to correctly get back the heap's array index starting from the node code.
Implementation of  Bellman-Ford's algorithm, using the shortest path code arleady written,
and testing it with a fully negative graph and a graph with only one negative edge

## CONSEGNA N.5 - KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM
Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm

## CONSEGNA N.6 - STRING AND FILE CHECK
Adaptation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to obtain a comparison between two versions of the same source code
